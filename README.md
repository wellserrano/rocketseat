# Rocketseat Explorer Course Portfolio

This portfolio is meant to group every practical class done while Rocketseat's Explorer course.
The idea is to present my progress during the course and explain the things I've learnt.
In the future, I plan to create more interactions and work on the way these "mini-projects" are presented.
